# Pascal AI Assistant Environment Variables - FIXED for Current Information
# CRITICAL: For current date/time queries to work, configure at least one API key below

# üéØ PERFORMANCE SETTINGS
PERFORMANCE_MODE=balanced              # speed/balanced/quality
STREAMING_ENABLED=true                 # Enable streaming for instant feedback  
KEEP_ALIVE_ENABLED=true               # Keep models loaded in memory
TARGET_RESPONSE_TIME=3.0              # Target max response time in seconds
MAX_RESPONSE_TOKENS=200               # Limit tokens for faster responses

# üöÄ ONLINE API KEYS (Required for Current Information Queries)
# CRITICAL: Current date, time, news, and recent info require online APIs

# Groq API (PRIMARY - Fastest & Most Reliable for Current Info)
# Get from: https://console.groq.com/
# FIXED FORMAT: New keys start with gsk_ (underscore, not dash)
GROQ_API_KEY=gsk_your_actual_groq_api_key_here

# Google Gemini API (SECONDARY - Free Alternative)  
# Get from: https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_actual_gemini_api_key_here

# OpenAI API (FALLBACK - Reliable but Paid)
# Get from: https://platform.openai.com/api-keys
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk_your_actual_openai_api_key_here

# ü¶ô OLLAMA SETTINGS (Offline LLM)
OLLAMA_HOST=http://localhost:11434
OLLAMA_TIMEOUT=30
OLLAMA_KEEP_ALIVE=30m              # Keep models loaded for 30 minutes

# üíæ MEMORY SETTINGS
SHORT_TERM_MEMORY_LIMIT=5
LONG_TERM_MEMORY_ENABLED=true
MEMORY_SAVE_INTERVAL=300

# üêõ DEBUG SETTINGS
DEBUG=false                       # Set to true for detailed debugging
LOG_LEVEL=INFO
PERF_LOG=false                    # Enable performance logging

# ‚öôÔ∏è ADVANCED SETTINGS
MAX_CONCURRENT_REQUESTS=2         # Limited for Pi 5 stability
CACHE_EXPIRY=3600
LLM_THREADS=4                     # Use all Pi 5 cores
LLM_CONTEXT=2048                  # Context window size

# üîß CURRENT INFO SETTINGS (Enhanced)
AUTO_ROUTE_CURRENT_INFO=true      # Automatically route current info queries online
FORCE_ONLINE_CURRENT_INFO=true    # Force online for current info (no offline fallback)
ENHANCE_CURRENT_INFO_PROMPTS=true # Add current date context to prompts
CURRENT_INFO_PRIORITY=true        # Prioritize current info routing

# üìù API KEY SETUP INSTRUCTIONS:

# üöÄ GROQ (Recommended - FASTEST for current info):
#   1. Go to https://console.groq.com/
#   2. Sign up for free account
#   3. Generate API key (IMPORTANT: starts with gsk_)
#   4. Replace gsk_your_actual_groq_api_key_here with your key
#   5. CRITICAL: New format uses gsk_ (underscore) not gsk- (dash)
#
# üü¢ GEMINI (Free alternative):
#   1. Go to https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey  
#   2. Sign in with Google account
#   3. Create API key
#   4. Replace your_actual_gemini_api_key_here with your key
#
# üîµ OPENAI (Paid but very reliable):
#   1. Go to https://platform.openai.com/api-keys
#   2. Sign up and add payment method
#   3. Create API key (starts with sk-)
#   4. Replace sk_your_actual_openai_api_key_here with your key

# üéØ CRITICAL FOR CURRENT INFORMATION:
# Without at least ONE configured API key above, queries like:
#   - "What day is today?"
#   - "What's the current date?"  
#   - "Who is the current president?"
#   - "What's in the news today?"
# Will NOT work properly and will show outdated information!

# üí° RECOMMENDATION:
# For best current info performance: Configure GROQ_API_KEY first
# Groq provides lightning-fast responses and excellent current info handling
# It's free for most usage and specifically optimized for real-time queries

# üîç TROUBLESHOOTING CURRENT INFO ISSUES:
# If Pascal says "September 13th, 2024" instead of 2025, or mentions knowledge cutoffs:
# 1. Make sure at least one API key above is properly configured
# 2. Check API key format: Groq keys start with gsk_, OpenAI with sk-
# 3. Verify API key has credits/quota available
# 4. Test API connection with: python test_groq_fix.py
# 5. Enable DEBUG=true to see routing decisions
# 6. Restart Pascal after changing API keys

# üîÑ MIGRATION FROM OLD FORMAT:
# If you previously used:
#   - GROK_API_KEY (rename to GROQ_API_KEY)  
#   - gsk- format (still works but gsk_ is preferred)
# The system will automatically detect both for compatibility

# ‚úÖ VERIFICATION:
# After configuring, test current info with these queries:
#   - "What day is today?"
#   - "What's the current date?"
#   - "What time is it?"
# These should give current 2025 information, not mention knowledge cutoffs

# üö´ WHAT NOT TO USE:
# Don't use these placeholder values (they won't work):
#   - gsk_your_groq_api_key_here
#   - your_gemini_api_key_here  
#   - sk_your_openai_api_key_here
#   - Empty values or spaces only

# üéØ FOR MAXIMUM CURRENT INFO PERFORMANCE:
# 1. Primary: GROQ_API_KEY (fastest, most reliable)
# 2. Secondary: GEMINI_API_KEY (free backup)
# 3. Fallback: OPENAI_API_KEY (premium reliability)
# Configure in order of preference - Pascal will use the best available
